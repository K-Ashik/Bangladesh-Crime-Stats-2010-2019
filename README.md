## Introduction

This project aims to analyze crime data spanning from 2010 to 2019 to gain insights into the trends and patterns of various criminal activities in different regions of Bangladesh. The analysis focuses on key crime categories such as Woman & Child Repression, Robbery, Murder, Narcotics, and more, with the goal of identifying trends, hotspots, and areas requiring targeted interventions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains crime data recorded across different units and regions of Bangladesh. Each entry in the dataset includes information about the type of crime, the number of cases reported, and the year in which the data was recorded.

## Analysis

The analysis involves examining the trends of various crime categories over the years, identifying regions with the highest number of cases, and exploring any significant variations or patterns in crime dynamics. Visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and treemaps are used to illustrate the findings and make them more accessible.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, several key insights have emerged regarding the prevalence of different types of crimes, regional variations, and the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts. These insights have important implications for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and stakeholders involved in crime prevention and public safety initiatives.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the crime landscape in Bangladesh and highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding and addressing societal challenges. By leveraging data analytics techniques, policymakers and law enforcement agencies can make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies to improve public safety and reduce crime rates.
